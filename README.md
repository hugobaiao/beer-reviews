Beer Rating Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 1.5+ million beer reviews to address the age-old question: what truly makes a great beer? By examining ratings across different styles, breweries, and alcohol content levels, we uncover patterns in beer preferences and identify top performers in the craft beer world.
Dataset
The dataset contains over 1.5 million beer reviews spanning:

66,055 unique beers
5,840 breweries
104 distinct beer styles
Reviews from 1996 to 2012

While the most recent reviews are from 2012, beer preferences tend to be relatively stable over time, and many of the highest-rated beers and breweries identified in this analysis remain influential in today's craft beer landscape.
Analysis Highlights

Identified top-performing beer styles based on average ratings
Explored the relationship between alcohol content (ABV) and beer ratings
Ranked breweries by consistent quality across their portfolio
Found the definitive "best in class" beers for popular styles
Examined which sensory components (taste, aroma, appearance, palate) drive overall ratings

Methodology
Initial data exploration and analysis were performed using MySQL queries on a MariaDB database. The core findings have been documented in the data_exploration.md file, which presents the results in a readable tabular format.
